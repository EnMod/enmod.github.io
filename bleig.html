          <h2>The Secret Sauce</h2><p>Have a seat, hang up your coat, stay a while, and I&#39;ll give you the grand tour of what powers my little slice of heaven.</p>
<h2 id="graphics-layout">Graphics/Layout</h2>
<p>Concerning prototyping and essentially all my graphics, I go with <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> for fast, free, useful SVG manipulation.  Nothing feels quite like the metaphor of having construction paper cutouts on your desk, ones you can pick up and move around at will.  Well, that&#39;s how I compare it to my (frustrating) experience with the Adobe graphics workflow.  I also use it for graphics layout and publishing setup, mainly due to the same qualities I listed.  Go get Inkscape!  Try it!  Share it!  It&#39;s great!!</p>
<h2 id="compilation">Compilation</h2>
<p>I build sites with the incomparable <a href="http://roots.cx">Roots</a> build system by <a href="https://github.com/jenius">Jeff Escalante</a>, utilizing static output for top speed and easy deployment.  It&#39;s surely made my life and stress management MUCH easier, allowing me to breathe with so many aspects of development taken care of behind the scenes. Roots slices, dices, watches files, LiveReloads the browser, deploys in one line to everything supported by <a href="">Ship</a>, renders all languages supported by <a href="">Accord</a> natively, all in a flash... I mean, unless you&#39;re already using some other great build tool like <a href="docpad.org">DocPad</a> or <a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a> you&#39;ll want to give Roots a go.</p>
<p>All the posts on the blog were grabbed from my posts published using the <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> API, added into my views through the <a href="https://github.com/carrot/roots-contentful">roots-contentful</a> extension at compile time, and copied into their own folders for deployment via the extension. That&#39;s right: Roots with Contentful even eliminates the need for a dynamic blog like WordPress!  Just configure your Contentful space for use in your project, set up your views, publish posts/assets on Contentful, and watch the magic.  Brilliant.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>I&#39;m all about KISS, so my engines/preprocessors of choice are Jade for HTML, Stylus for CSS, and LiveScript for JavaScript.  Yeah yeah, everyone uses CoffeeScript, but even that has too many commas for my liking.  LiveScript&#39;s syntax is also way friendlier to me in terms of how I can structure functions or curry them, so major props to <a href="https://github.com/gkz">George Zahariev</a> for getting that going. I also make obsessive use of jQuery, <a href="http://axis.netlify.com/">Axis</a> for useful Stylus mixins, and <a href="https://github.com/corysimmons/lost">Lost Grid</a> for an incredibly simple PostCSS grid; definitely wouldn&#39;t be here without them and, really, neither would my site.</p>
<h2 id="ux">UX</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s get a little more specific: noticed all those snazzy animations on the main page?  You can thank <a href="http://julian.com/research/velocity/">VeloctiyJS</a> and its creator <a href="http://julian.com/">Julian Shapiro</a> for that. It replaces jQuery&#39;s .animate() with a friendly syntax and PURE QUICKSILVER.  Also from Julian is the tech behind &quot;Developer of...&quot; animation, namely his <a href="http://julian.com/research/blast/">Blast library</a>.  If you&#39;ve ever played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSQ6nCiq5jY">Lost Odyssey</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mistwalkercorp.guardians&amp;hl=en">Terra Battle</a> (of <a href="http://www.mistwalkercorp.com/en/">Mistwalker</a> fame), you could easily see where I got inspiration for typographical animation; Blast allows devs to implement that animation style <em>perfectly.</em>  Expect to see it applied to some of my Stories in a later version of the site/blog.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I&#39;ve gotta give it to <a href="https://github.com/kenwheeler">Ken Wheeler</a> for his <a href="https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/">Slick carousel</a>.  Without it I&#39;d still be using Juicebox for that image gallery...<em>shudder</em></p>

          <h2>Welcome to the new (final) blog!</h2><p>This will be the one I stick with, promise!</p>
<p>It feels great to try out new, stable technologies and efficient workflows. No more middlemen, no more extra steps, no more fuss.  Just my thoughts in Markdown, organized with metadata, managed by Contentful, rendered with Jade, Stylus, and LiveScript, using Roots to compile. Nothing, NOTHING to this point has felt so...right.  It&#39;s finally as if everything for my dream site has fallen into place, what with Roots proving to be a faster, more modular, and less technical DocPad, along with the CMS solution of my dreams in Contentful with the roots-contentful extension for Roots.  Ahhhhh...</p>
<p>Well the road to this point hasn&#39;t been easy.  I&#39;ll start you off at the beginning, when I thought about giving the old site a facelift.</p>
<h1 id="wait-i-can-host-my-own-wordpress-">Wait, I Can Host <em>My Own</em> WordPress?!</h1>
<p>Not even three or four years ago (and hell, even now), if you asked anyone where to start blogging they would reply &quot;WordPress, definitely!&quot; &quot;Use WordPress!&quot; &quot;WordPress is great!&quot;  This meant wordpress.com, the managed-hosted version most people are familiar with.  Upon creation of the previous version of this site I wanted to add a blog component, so I thought about moving over my WordPress blog to the site but became distressed when I realized WordPress isn&#39;t self-hosted...until I found wordpress.org!</p>
